# Workshop 3 - STM32 Timers and PWM

Device consists of STM32F407-DISCOVERY and Global Logic Embedded Starter Kit Extension Board.

There are 4 LEDs on a stm32 board controlled by 5 switches on an Extension Board. Device controls these LEDs using self-generated PWM signal.

## User manual

<ins>**User control**</ins>

SWT2 (center) - change PWM signal output LED (cyclically, red -> orange -> green -> blue -> none -> red ...).

SWT1 (right) - add 5 % to PWM duty cycle,

SWT3 (left) - subtract 5 % from PWM duty cycle,

SWT4 (up) - multiply PWM signal frequency by 2,

SWT5 (down) - divide PWM signal frequency by 2
